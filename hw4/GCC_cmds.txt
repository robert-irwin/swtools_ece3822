# Heres the list of commands used to compile the code.

# Once the code was written, we compiled and linked the files into an executable
# called hw_04.exe.  This was done using the following commands.

gcc -c f_01.cc
gcc -c f_00.cc

# These commands create the object files f_01.o and f_00.o.  Then we link these
# files and create the executable using O2 optimaztion as shown below.

gcc -O2 f_00.o f_01.o -o hw_04.exe

# Creating the library that contains the function ece_3822_add_sin is done by:

ar rvs libsinece3822.a f_01.o ar rvs libsinece3822.a f_01.o
ranlib libsinece3822.a

# To compile and link the program using this library we do:
gcc f_00.o -L. -lsinece3822 -o f_00.exe

# To generate a file that contains the assembly code...
gcc -S f_00.cc
